Code for simple games in Pygame Zero

This repository contains code for some simple games which students could make in PyGame Zero.

Order should probably go something like:

1. Fruit Catcher
2. Busy Bee
3. Target Practice
4. Dangerous Driving

In Dangerous Driving, the lasers are an add-on for students who finish early!
